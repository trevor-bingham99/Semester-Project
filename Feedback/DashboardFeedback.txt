From Connor: I like the dashboard and visualizations you made.  I like what you did with the correlation heatmap, it's a lot like what I did lol.  I was curious about this point in one of the graphs, which had 420 acres but is has 0 TOT_VALUE. I would also suggest seeing if there's some way you can optimize the code for this graph, since selecting the year range has a larger amount of wait time than I would expect

From Cici:

From Ashley: I think this is pretty cool, it is easy to read through and there are some good interactive elements that make it easy to play around with. Nicely done!

Creating the dashboard wasn't too hard to do, since when I was doing my EDA and making charts, I used plotly so it would be easier to copy those graphs over. I did run into some issues with interactive elements, but I was able to figure those out after looking online at some documentation help. I also had an issue where I forgot to include a requirements.txt file and didn't realize for a while, but eventually got that figured out. 
I looked into some of Connor's points, but the data just shows that point having 0 value for whatever reason, I am not sure why. And I looked into optimizing the year distribution, but couldn't find a way to make it load faster than it does already.
