From Connor: Also looks good!  I found one little misspelling: "To acheive this"  I would also recommend briefly explaining what some of your variables mean, especially the ones in this graph and the other ones.  You talk about the important take aways in the written text, but it's hard for me to look at that and understand what's going on without more information.


From Cici: 

From Tyler: I really like how you have this laid out, it flows very well from one point to the next, and you can understand a lot of your process of looking into the data. I would maybe see about adding a bit more detail for the heatmap description, but it looks great. 

To address some of the feedback I got, I went through and did a spell and grammar check, and made the corrections where necessary. From Connor's comment on the heat map being hard to understand, I went through and tried to clean it a little, but also added a section explaining if they wanted to understand/explore more, they should go to the dashboard where it is more interactive.

My first draft was finished in the SHA number 775a5f9374214f55883cc4e624ae0a05024d83fc.
